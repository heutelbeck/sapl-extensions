== General Information
Before the digital age, the place where sensitive information was kept was part of the protective measures to secure it from unwanted access. In today's world of digital information it has become equally important to secure server centers and storage sites from physical access. However, due to the advancements of network technology the person accessing data from these centers could be geographically located anywhere. The only thing he needs is a proper network connection and his credentials to authorize himself.

There are plenty of scenarios in which the current position of the user asking for access plays a vital role. A few ones of those predominantly found in the literature will be presented in the following.

* Medical data of patients are highly sensitive. A clinician shall not be granted access to the medical records of his patients outside of his duty and therefore be allowed to view and edit them only from inside the hospital. 
* A company is working on some innovative ideas and projects that need the highest amount of protection to avoid the risk of being copied by the competition. Therefore it has introduced a _safe room_ that is cut off from the outside world as much as possible. Employees working on the innovative projects can only access related data when they are inside this room.
* Military documents that are classified on a certain confidentiality level must only be accessed from within the military base. Therefore the access is only granted if the user is inside.

To put an authorization control in this form into practice, the concept of *location based access* (LBA) was created. As SAPL is an attribute-based access control (ABAC) with his architectural patterns based on http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html[XACML] it seems intuitively to introduce geographical functions and attributes into policies and thereby allow LBA. This is exactly what the SAPL-Geo module establishes. 

== User guidelines
=== Geometries
==== Supported types
As SAPL is loosely based on the patterns and structure of http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html[XACML] it is the obvious choice to make use of the http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geoxacml[GeoXACML standard] for implementing a LBA approach. GeoXACML is a geo-specific extension of the XACML standard that has its main strength in  declaring and enforcing access rights for geospatial data (e.g. in geographic information system, etc.) in a flexible way. This is clearly not the exact purpose of the SAPL-Geo extension, however, as the two domains are quite similar all of these functions and operations become useful in the environment of LBA as well.

In accordance with this standard the following geometries are available in SAPL-Geo. Additionally, one or more of these geometries can be grouped together in a common `GeometryCollection` object.

.Geometries provided in SAPL-Geo according to the http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=42734[GeoXACML specification]
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|======================
|Geometry | Explanation
|Point | A Point is a 0-dimensional geometric object and represents a single location in
coordinate space. A Point has an x-coordinate value, a y-coordinate value. 
|LineString | A LineString is a Curve with linear interpolation between Points. Each
consecutive pair of Points defines a Line segment.
|Polygon | A Polygon is a planar Surface defined by 1 exterior boundary and 0 or more
interior boundaries. Each interior boundary defines a hole in the Polygon. 
|MultiPoint | A MultiPoint is a 0-dimensional GeometryCollection. The elements of a
MultiPoint are restricted to Points.
|MultiLineString | A MultiLineString is a MultiCurve whose elements are LineStrings. 
|MultiPolygon | A MultiPolygon is a MultiSurface whose elements are Polygons.
|======================

==== Supported data formats
In general there are multiple standards to exchange and store geometric objects. SAPL-Geo makes vastly use of GeoJSON, as the general syntax and object mapping in SAPL already support the JSON-format. However, as external systems frequently work with other standards as well, the following most common ones are supported.

GeoJSON:: http://geojson.org/[The GeoJSON-Standard] is based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946[RFC 7946] and aligns itself exactly with the requirements that are imposed by GeoXACML. Please note that for reasons of simplicity the `Feature` and `FeatureCollection` parts are not supported in SAPL-Geo.

IMPORTANT: GeoJSON is the only format that is accepted right inside of policies and variables. The other supported formats can be used only within the AttributeFinder or Java source code.

{
   "pointOne":{ 
	"type": "Point",
	"coordinates":
			[10.0, 15.0]
	}
}
----

Well-known Text (WKT):: Well-known Text (WKT) was originally defined by the http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc[Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)] and is described in detail in the http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html[ISO 19162:2015 specification]. It provides an easy and readable way of representing geometric objects and spatial features. 

----
POINT (10 15)
----

Keyhole Markup Language (KML):: The Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is a XML-based standard by the http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc[OGC] and is described in the http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=23689[best practices]. It mainly became famous for the use in Google Earth and associated software and uses WGS84 as the only CRS. Geometries from KML files can be loaded into policies via the AttributeFinder either from the filesystem or a HTTP-address (see <<sec:kml, KML Import>>).



=== Coordinate Reference Systems
SAPL-Geo supports the projection of coordinates into different coordinate reference systems (CRS). Depending on how the geospatial data is extracted from third party systems, this might be required to facilitate comparisons and to simplify the use of the provided geospatial functions. The CRS are loaded from the https://www.epsg-registry.org/[EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset] and identified by their respective codes (e.g. _EPSG:4326_ for the WGS84-CRS). 

Two different parameters are required retrieve a mathematical transformation for a projection:

Source CRS:: The Source CRS is the system that decoded the coordinates of the external data. 

Destination CRS:: The Destination CRS is the system into which the coordinates will be projected. 

Usually you would first have to define a projection via the `getProjection`-function and thereafter convert your data with the `project`-function. Detailed information about the syntax can be found in the <<sec:function_reference, Function reference>>.


=== Embedding the module
To use the SAPL-Geo FunctionLibrary a new instance of `GeoFunctionLibrary` has to be loaded into the `FunctionContext`. The `GeoPolicyInformationPoint` is included into the `AttributeContext` analogously as the following code shows.

[source,java]
----
FUNCTION_CTX.loadLibrary(new GeoFunctionLibrary()); <1>
ATTRIBUTE_CTX.loadPolicyInformationPoint(new GeoPolicyInformationPoint()); <2>
----

<1> Loads a new instance of `GeoFunctionLibrary` into the `FunctionContext`.
<2> Loads the `GeoPolicyInformationPoint` into the `AttributeContext`.

If the Policy Decision Point (PDP) is configured via a `pdp.json` one would just have to add `io.sapl.pip.geo` to the AttributeFinders and `geo` to the libraries.
     
That way all geographical functions are registered to the SAPL interpreter and can be accessed within policies via the keyword `geo`. For an exhaustive list of all provided functions and their syntax please refer to the <<sec:function_reference, Function Reference>> or <<sec:attribute_reference, Attribute Reference>> respectively. The following sample demonstrates the use of the library within a policy description:


.Sample policy using a geographical function
----
val userPos := subject.username.<sapl.geo.tracker>.position; <1>
val hospital := subject.institution.<sapl.geo.gis>.geofences.hospital; <2>

policy "SAPL-Geo Sample"
permit resource =~ "^https://medical.org/api/patients.*"
where
  subject.username.<user.profile>.group == "doctor";
  geo.within(userPos, hospital); <3>
----

<1> Loads the current geographical position of the user from an external tracking software that is connected to the policy engine via the `GeoPolicyInformationPoint`.
<2> Loads a polygon object describing the geographical area of the hospital from an external geographic information system (GIS) that is connected to the policy engine via the `GeoPolicyInformationPoint`.
<3> Uses the function `within` from the `GeoFunctionLibrary` to check, whether the user position is currently inside the hospital or not. 

TIP: All possible fields that are returned from the `GeoPolicyInformationPoint` are listed in the <<sec:geopipresponse, Response object>>.


[[sec:attribute_reference]]
== Attribute reference
To make the best use from location based authorization it is usually required to connect external systems to the policy engine to retrieve certain data (such as the user location, geofences from an external library, etc.). These systems could comprise tracking system, mobile device management systems (MDM) or even geographic information systems (GIS). Unfortunately there does not yet exist one standardized interface or protocol to retrieve data from different sources, which is why the `GeoPolicyInformationPoint` is build in a modular way. Each module makes use of a standard data exchange formats wherever possible and on top provides an individual configuration for the specific system to connect to. There are already a few connection adapters predefined but it is, of course, left open to the developer to write an own adapter to integrate a particular system. Additionally, a common standardized format is defined for the responses which is described in <<sec:geopipresponse, Response object>>.

=== PostGIS
http://postgis.net/[PostGIS] is a geo-spatial extension to https://www.postgresql.org[PostgreSQL] object-relational databases. It has become very popular especially within open source applications and is widely used for storing and querying geo-spatial data. Therefore multiple servers, applications and tools use PostGIS as their database backend. SAPL-Geo is therefore able to connect to such a database as well, retrieve geometries of interest and make them accessible directly from within policies. 

A PostGIS database can be connected via the AttributeFinder `io.sapl.pip.geo.postgis` while the configuration has to be in the following format.

[[postgisconfig]]
.Structure of the configuration for the PostGIS Policy Information Point
[source,java]
----
public class PostGISConfig {
    private String serverAddress; <1>
    private String port; <2>
    private String db; <3>
    private String table; <4>
    private String username; <5>
    private String password; <6>
    private String pkColName; <7>
    private String idColName; <8>
    private String geometryColName; <9>
    private int from; <10>
    private int until; <11>
    private int projectionSRID; <12>
    private boolean flipCoordinates; <13>
    private boolean ssl; <14>
    private String urlParams; <15>
}
----

<1> Address (URL) of the PostGIS database.
<2> Port of the PostGIS database.
<3> Name of the database to be imported.
<4> Name of the table to be imported.
<5> Username to access the database.
<6> Password to access the database.
<7> Name of the column that holds the primary key of the data.
<8> Name of the column that holds the descriptive name of the data. This name will later be used to identify the geofences in the polices.
<9> Name of the column that holds the geometries.
<10> Numeric start primary key, from which the geometries shall be imported.
<11> Numeric end primary key, until which the geometries shall be imported. If none is provided, all geometries beginning from *10* are imported.
<12> The SRID into which the coordinates will be projected during the import. If no projection is required the field can just be left empty or assigned a `0` instead.
<13> Boolean to decide, whether the coordinates shall be flipped before being imported into the policy. The rationale here is, that GIS-databases usually store `X` and `Y` values, whereas SAPL-Geo works with Latitude and Longitude values (see http://postgis.net/2013/08/18/tip_lon_lat/[this article] for further information).
<14> Establishes a SSL-connection to the database if set to `true`. Please note that server certificate (respectively the CA of the servers certificate) must be trusted in a TrustStore. Further options can be set in the custom `urlParams` field.
<15> Further arguments that can be specified freely and will be passed when establishing the connection to the database. Multiple parameters must be delimited using the `&`-sign.


[[sec:kml]]
=== KML Import
KML-files can be imported into SAPL policies via the PIP `sapl.pip.geo.kml`, whereby the configuration only exists of the filename (that must exist in a predefined directory) or the HTTP/HTTPS-address. All `<Placemark>` attributes will be imported and made accessible via their `<Name>` tags.

IMPORTANT: A bug is currently present in the GeoTools KML import dependency. If a `<LookAt>` tag exists within a `<Placemark>` tag in the KML-file, only the very first geometry within the `<MultiGeometry>` will be imported.

=== Traccar
https://www.traccar.org[Traccar] is a fleet managing and tracking software. Multiple devices can log their GPS systems onto the server. Furthermore, the frontend also allows for an easy creation and configuration of geofences. The PIP `sapl.pip.geo.traccar` connects to the Traccar server via a RESTful service and therefore requires the following configuration:

[[traccarconfig]]
.Structure of the configuration for the Traccar Policy Information Point
[source,java]
----
public class TraccarConfig {
    private String url; <1>
    private String deviceID; <2>
    private String credentials; <3>
    private String username; <4>
    private String password; <5>
    private int posValidityTimespan; <6>
}
----

<1> Address (URL) of the Traccar server.
<2> ID of the device from which the information shall be retrieved.
<3> Base64-encoded string of username and password to access the Traccar server (can be replaced by giving *4* and *5* alternatively).
<4> Username to access the Traccar server.
<5> Password to access the Traccar server.
<6> Timeframe in minutes, during which the last position update must have taken place to be considered as a current position.


[[sec:geopipresponse]]
=== Response object

To facilitate and standardize the use of the the `GeoPolicyInformationPoint` within SAPL policies, all the individual modules respond to requests in a common way. Hence, a general skeleton in form of a `GeoPIPResponse` is being created, which holds all the relevant information. It is basically divided into two parts, whereby the first one (<1> until <6>) holds information about the user's position and the other one (<6>) stores geometries/geofences. If a certain value cannot be retrieved from the source system, the respective value in the response equals the standard value for the datatype or is empty instead.

[[geopipresponse]]
.Structure of the response class for the GeoPolicyInformationPoint
[source,java]
----
public class GeoPIPResponse {
    private final String identifier; <1>
    private final JsonNode position; <2>
    private final double altitude; <3>
    private final String lastUpdate; <4>
    private final double accuracy; <5>
    private final double trust; <6>
    private final ObjectNode geofences; <7>
}
----

<1> A general identifier. Depending on the specific request it could e.g. represent a device-ID that has been tracked or the common name of a collection of geofences.
<2> The user's position as a GeoJSON point object. Can be utilized for immediate further use in all functions of the GeoFunctionLibrary.
<3> The altitude relating to the user's position.
<4> Time and date of the last position update of the user. Formatted in the ISO 8601 standard for further use in the respective time and date function libraries.
<5> Estimated position error of the user's position in [m]. It is usually calculated by the respective tracking or positioning systems.
<6> Trust value of the users position. The value on a scale between 0 (not trusted) and 1 (fully trustworthy) represents e.g. how easily the position could be spoofed (obviously depending on the used tracking system).
<7> Collection of geofences in which each one can be addressed by its name (see sample below).
